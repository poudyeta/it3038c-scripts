# Image Processing Showcase

## Introduction

This Python script showcases various image processing techniques using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It applies transformations to a given image (`car.png`) and combines them into a single display.

## Techniques Used

1. **Rotation**
   - The original image is rotated by 180 degrees.

2. **Desaturation**
   - The color saturation of the image is reduced to grayscale.

3. **Sharpness Enhancement**
   - The sharpness of the image is intensified.

4. **Horizontal Flip**
   - The image is flipped horizontally.

## Usage

1. **Requirements**
   - Python 3.x
   - PIL Library

2. **Installation**
   - Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install the PIL library by running `pip install Pillow`.

3. **Running the Script**
   - Place your desired image in the same directory as the script and rename it as `car.png`.

4. **Output**
   - The resulting image will be displayed.
